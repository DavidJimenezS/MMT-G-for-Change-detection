# MMT-G-for-Change-detection
MULTI-MODAL/TEMPORAL GRAPH FUSION FOR CHANGE DETECTION IN MULTI-SPECTRAL IMAGES

## MMT-G
  Here you will find all the code used to generate a change map in two cases: i) Flooding, ii) Fire.
  
  1. CD_detection.m is the main code that generates the changes map.
  2. binary_kappa.m will generate all the results showed in the paper and also the change map with respec to FA, MA, P, R, K, OE.
